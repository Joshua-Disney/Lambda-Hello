Hello, my name is Josh Disney.

Three words that describe me are gamer, empathetic, and ambitious.

My favorite hobby, by far, is playing video games.  I've been playing since I was 8 years old when my next door neighbor let me play 
duck hunt on his NES.  My highest career goal is to own and operate my own video game company.
